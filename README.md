# Scikit-TDA

Scikit-TDA is an opinionated collection of libraries for Topological Data Analysis. The user interfaces across all included libraries are standardized and compatible with numpy and scikit-learn.

Currently, we include
- [Kepler Mapper](https://github.com/MLWave/kepler-mapper) for mapper and visualization.
- [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/UMAP) for dimensionality reduction.
- [ripser](https://github.com/sauln/ripser) for persistent homology (coming soon).
- [persim](https://github.com/sauln/persim) for persistence images.
