<h1>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Compiled here are a set of frequently asked questions,
along with answers. If you don’t find your question listed here
then please feel free to add an
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/new">issue on github</a>.
More questions are always welcome, and the authors will do
their best to answer. If you feel you have a common question
that isn’t answered here then please suggest that the question
(and answer) be added to the FAQ when you file the issue.</p>
<div class="section" id="should-i-normalise-my-features">
<h2>Should I normalise my features?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-i-normalise-my-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The default answer is yes, but, of course, the real answer is
“it depends”. If your features have meaningful relationships
with one another (say, latitude and longitude vales) then
normalising per feature is not a good idea. For features that
are essentially independent it does make sense to get all the
features on (relatively) the same scale. The best way to do
this is to use
<a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html">pre-processing tools from scikit-learn</a>.
All the advice given there applies as sensible preprocessing
for UMAP, and since UMAP is scikit-learn compatible you
can put all of this together into a <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html">scikit-learn pipeline</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-cluster-the-results-of-umap">
<h2>Can I cluster the results of UMAP?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-cluster-the-results-of-umap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is hard to answer well, but essentially the answer is
“yes, with care”. To start with it matters what clustering
algorithm you are going to use. Since UMAP does not necessarily
produce clean spherical clusters something like K-Means
is a poor choice. I would recommend
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a> or
similar. The catch here is that UMAP, with its uniform density
assumption, does not preserve density well. What UMAP will do,
however, is contract connected components of the manifold
together. Providing you have enough data for UMAP to
distinguish that information then you can get <em>useful</em>
clustering results out since algorithms like HDBSCAN will
easily pick out the components after applying UMAP.</p>
<p>UMAP does offer significant improvements over algorithms
like t-SNE for clustering. First, by preserving more
global structure and creating meaningful separation
between connected components of the manifold on which
the data lies, UMAP offers more meaningful clusters.
Second, because it supports arbitrary embedding
dimensions, UMAP allows embedding to larger dimensional
spaces that make it more amenable to clustering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-clusters-are-all-squashed-together-and-i-can-t-see-internal-structure">
<h2>The clusters are all squashed together and I can’t see internal structure<a class="headerlink" href="#the-clusters-are-all-squashed-together-and-i-can-t-see-internal-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of UMAPs goals is to have distance between clusters of points
be meaningful. This means that clusters can end up spread out
with a fair amount of space between them. As a result the
clusters themselves can end up more visually packed together
than in, say, t-SNE. This is intended. A catch, however, is
that many plots (for example matplotlib’s scatter plot with
default parameters) tend to show the clusters only as indistinct
blobs with no internal structure. The solution for this is
really a matter of tuning the plot more than anything else.</p>
<p>If you are using matplotlib consider using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code> parameter
that specifies the glyph size in scatter plots. Depending on
how much data you have reducing this to anything from 5 to
0.001 can have a notable effect. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">size</span></code> parameter in
bokeh is similarly useful (but does not need to be quite so small).</p>
<p>More generally the real solution, particular with large datasets,
is to use <a class="reference external" href="http://datashader.org/">datashader</a> for plotting.
Datashader is a plotting llibrary that handles aggregation
of large scale data in scatter plots in a way that can better
show the underlying detail that can otherwise be lost. We
highly recommend investing the time to learn datashader for
UMAP plot particularly for larger datasets.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-there-gpu-or-multicore-cpu-support">
<h2>Is there GPU or multicore-CPU support?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-gpu-or-multicore-cpu-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not at this time. The bottlenecks in the code are the
(approximate) nearest neighbor search and the optimization
of the low dimensional representation. The first of these
(ANN) is performed by a random projection forest and
nearest-neighbor-descent. Both of those are, at the least,
parellelisable in principle, and could be converted to
support multicore (at the cost of single core performance).
The optimization is performed via a (slightly custom)
stochastic gradient descent. SGD is both parallelisable
and amenable to GPUs. This means that in principle UMAP
could support multicore and use GPUs for optimization.
In practice this would involve GPU expertise and would
potentially hurt single core performance, and so has
been deferred for now. If you have expertise in GPU
programming with Numba and would be interested in
adding GPU support we would welcome your contributions.</p>

<div class="section" id="can-i-add-a-custom-loss-function">
<h2>Can I add a custom loss function?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-add-a-custom-loss-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To allow for fast performance the SGD phase of UMAP has
been hand-coded for the specific needs of UMAP. This makes
custom loss functions a little difficult to handle. Now
that Numba (as of version 0.38) supports passing functions
it is posisble that future versions of UMAP may support
such functionality. In the meantime you should definitely
look into <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jmelville/smallvis">smallvis</a>,
a library for t-SNE, LargeVis, UMAP, and related algorithms.
Smallvis only works for small datasets, but provides
much greater flexibility and control.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-the-support-for-the-r-language">
<h2>Is the support for the R language?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-the-support-for-the-r-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes! A number of people have worked hard to make UMAP
available to R users.</p>
<p>If you want to use the reference
implementation under the hood but want a nice R interface
the we recommend <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/umapr">umapr</a>
which wraps the python code with reticulate.</p>
<p>If you want a pure R version then there are a couple
of options: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkonopka/umap">UMAP</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot">UWOT</a>. Both are good
reimplementations of UMAP in R. If performance is
a major factor we recommend UWOT at this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-there-a-c-c-implementation">
<h2>Is there a C/C++ implementation?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-a-c-c-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not that we are aware of. For now Numba has done a very
admirable job of providing high performance and the
developers of UMAP have not felt the need to move to
lower level languages. At some point a multithreaded
C++ implementation may be made available, but there are
no time-frames for when that would happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-can-t-get-umap-to-run-properly">
<h2>I can’t get UMAP to run properly!<a class="headerlink" href="#i-can-t-get-umap-to-run-properly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are, inevitably, a number of issues and corner cases
that can cause issues for UMAP. Some know issues that can
cause problems are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>UMAP doesn’t currently support 32-bit Windows.
This is due to issues with Numba of that platform
and will not likely be resolved soon. Sorry :-(</li>
<li>If you have pip installed the package <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap</span></code>
at any time (instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap-learn</span></code>) this can
cause serious issues. You will want to purge/remove
everything umap related in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></code>
directory and re-install <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap-learn</span></code>.</li>
<li>Having any files called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap.py</span></code> in the current
directory you will have issues as that will be
loaded instead of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">umap</span></code> module.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth checking the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues">issues page on github</a>
for potential solutions. If all else fails please add an
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/new">issue on github</a>.</p>
