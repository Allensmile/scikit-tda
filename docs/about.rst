This entire project hinges on quality documentation.  

- Documentation and examples
    - Explain basic theory in lay-person language
    - Provide basic examples of usage
    - Provide notebooks showing basic usages

- Interesting examples
    - Using UMAP to reduce dimension before computing diagrams
    - Using persistence images for classification
    - Extracting cycles and visualizing them on UMAP reduced dimension.
