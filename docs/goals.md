This project will provide a home for compatible TDA libraries and provide comprehensive documentation intended for non-researchers.

All libraries included in scikit-tda will have a similar feel

- Basic Software hygiene
    - Use issue tracker, encourage pull requests, and be friendly to users.
    - Provide a test suite and work towards increasing test coverage.
    - Be installable through scikit-tda.

This library must be able to execute test suites for each of the submodules. 

Follow scikit-learn [coding guidelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines)
